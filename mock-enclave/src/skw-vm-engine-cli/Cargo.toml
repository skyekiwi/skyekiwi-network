description = """
A command line wrapper around `skw-vm-engine.`
All error messages that can be raised during the contract execution are raised by `skw-vm-engine`
and the all effects of computing the execution result of a smart contract are encapsulated inside `skw-vm-engine`.

One can use `skw-vm-engine-cli` to test the smart contracts, e.g. with integration tests
to make sure it has expected behavior once deployed to the blockchain.
