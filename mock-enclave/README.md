## The Mock-Enclave
This is used to simulate the offchain VM behaviors outside TEE before the SkyeKiwi Network hit mainnet. See README in the project root for a detailed technical roadmap on the usage of the mock-enclave. The Mock-Enclave works hand in hand with `@skyekiwi/s-contract` package from the SkyeKiwi Protocol Repo.
